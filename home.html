    <p class="lparagraph">I'm Gareth, a programmer, (extremely novice) designer, (also extremely novice)
        calligrapher and (most of all) a student. I was born,
        grew up in, and I'm currently living in South Africa. Ever since I was first introduced to it I.T. has been
        my
        biggest interest and this website has been a little passion project of mine for a couple of months.</p>
    <p class="lparagraph">There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning
        from failure.<span class="quote"> ~Colin Powell </span></p>

    <p class="rparagraph">
        I made this website for two reasons. Firstly because I wanted to offer my services as a web developer for
        people who didn't want to pay
        thousands of dollars for their own personal website and secondly because I thought it would be usefull to be
        able to
        have one centralised place to check where to learn each programming language because there's nothing more noble
        than using
        your free time to better yourself.

        You're probably asking yourself why me of all people to develop your website well here's why:
    </p>

    <div class="leftThird">
        <h1>Cost</h1>
        <img src="money.png" />
        <p>Objectively speaking, compared to most of the freelance web developers out there I'm on the much, much
            cheaper side of things. Don't fret, I can assure you, you won't lose any quality. I just thought it would
            be
            nice to give people access to websites that don't require you to take out a mortgage on your house.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="middleThird">
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <img src="chip.png" />
        <p>I've always loved a challenge and this is nothing short of that; a challenge. Any projects I undertake will
            provide me with more experience leaving more knowledgeable than when I started.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rightThird">
        <h1>One-on-One</h1>
        <img src="speech-bubble.png"/>
        <p>You'll get the entire experience! Depending on exactly what you want I can work off of your design,
            photoshop mockup, description etc. Or if you prefer I can design it from scratch from the ground up. Any way you prefer
            to do it I can adapt to, in order to suit your needs in their entirety.
